# Overview

This is a solver for https://fastflood.dylancastillo.co/

## Usage

To get started, copy the local `example_states.json` file and rename it to `states.json`, then run `nim -d:release r main.nim`.
Note that if you're using your own states (not the example states), then additional fields to `grid` will be ignored.
